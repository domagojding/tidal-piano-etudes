### E.1

```haskell
d1 $ note "c6 d6" # sound "superpiano" 
```
- `d1:` This creates a pattern in the first sound channel.
- note `"c6 d6"`: This plays the notes C6 and D6 (high octave notes) in sequence.
- `# sound "superpiano"`: This specifies the superpiano sound, which is a built-in sound in SuperDirt (SuperCollider) that works with TidalCycles.

### E.2

```haskell
d1 $ note "c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 a5 b5 c6"
```
> *How do I keep the same time since it seems the more notes I add the faster it sounds?*

> Rephrase: *How can I maintain a consistent tempo as I add more notes, without the pattern speeding up?*

By default, TidalCycles will fit your notes into a single cycle, meaning that adding more notes will make the cycle play faster to fit them all. To avoid this and keep the same timing, you can explicitly control the cycle length using the slow or fast functions or by specifying the number of cycles that the pattern should span.

### E.3

```haskell
d1 $ slow 2 $ note "c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 a5 b5 c6"
-- try fast 1,2,3,4.. slow 1,2,3,4
```

### E.4

```haskell
d1 $ note "0 2 4 5 7 9 11 12"
-- defining the intervals (in semitones) between notes in the scale.

d1 $ note "0 2 4 5 7 9 11 12" # octave 1
-- changing octaves

-- 0 2 4 5 7 9 ~ 11 ~ 12
-- ~ as pause within cycle

d1 $ note "0 2 [4 4]" # octave 5
-- twice in the same time meaning it's still a three step sequence but the third has two

d1 $ note "[0 c1 c8] 2*3 [4 4]"
-- variations with groupings and with * multiplication
