# tidal-piano-etudes
A collection of piano etudes composed in TidalCycles, progressing from simple to complex. 

I’m starting this repository as a kind of exploration. I want to write piano etudes in TidalCycles, beginning from scratch and working towards more complex transformations and functions that, eventually, I hope to use in live performances.

Right now, it's all pretty basic—I'm just trying to map out how I can use the piano sounds, and these etudes are more like loose ideas or experiments rather than polished pieces. Some of the things I’d like to explore are symmetrical melody and harmony building, drawing inspiration from composers like Arvo Pärt and Messiaen. I also want to play around with designing scales and see where that takes me.

Another thing I want to explore is using TidalCycles alongside my classical guitar improvisations. I’m thinking of it as more than just a metronome—it would generate compositions that I could play along with on the guitar, helping me develop my improvisation. It’s like a tool for creating a kind of "smart accompaniment" that responds to and pushes my ideas further.
